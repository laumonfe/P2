# P2
Industrial manipulator for repetitive tasks. This project focuses on path 
planning for a UR5 which's goal is to place rotors from a conveyor belt to 
a working station in an industrial environment. As mentioned, the main focus was on the Kinematics 
of the manipulator, and therefore, the videos shown showcasing the UR5 are merely a proof of concept, since the 
robot was programmed by demonstration and not with a script. 


Additionally, there is a mini project where a ladder is equiped with different sensors in order to make it intenlligent. 
This was impleneted using an Arduino UNO.
